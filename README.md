# Mid Term Project

**Welcome** to my web page! I can't wait for you to  
learn all about me!

## Reason for this [web page](https://github.com/Tpack12/Midterm-Project/edit/main/Reason-for-web-page.md)

I have created this personal webpage as a midterm project.
But also to display information about myself.

### It is important that I am creating this webpage because it will..
1. Count for a grade as my midterm.
2. Will also improve my skills with the usage of markdown.

#### Travel to this [page](https://github.com/Tpack12/Midterm-Project/edit/main/Family.md) to learn about my family...
