# Family
  [Family](https://www.britannica.com/topic/family-kinship) is very important to me and they have been  
a key piece of my life for a long time. Especially my father.  
He has always been there for me no matter the situation  
and always provides a solution to any problem I encounter.  
Not to mention he taught me everything he knows and more.
