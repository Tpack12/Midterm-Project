# Reason for creating this website

This web page is being created as my **midterm project** for _INFOTC-1000_.  
The information that is shared on the following pages is all about me,  
my interests and other information in general that relates to me.  
This project is important to me because it allows me to show my skills  
using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) that I have  recently acquired over this past week.  
Finally I feel this webpage will also help anyone who sees it learn about me.  


As far as markdown is concerned though I feel it is a useful language and  
some good things to know about it are...
