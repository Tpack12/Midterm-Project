# Studies at the University of Missouri
I am currently studying Information Technology at the  
_University of Missouri_. I am only a freshman, but I  
feel very good about my desicion and can tell I made  
the right choice coming to [Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_Missouri). As well as  
studying Information Technology at Mizzou, I wish to  
gather the course credits for a certification in  
**Cyber Security**. Or possibly even a minor in  
**Cyber Security** if that is offered at the  
_University of Missouri_.

## Current Courseload
* English-1000
* History-1100
* INFOTC-1000
* INFOTC-1040
